        <h2>Xi'an's Culture and Tradition</h2>
        <p>As a famous historical and cultural city in China, Xi'an has a rich cultural heritage, such as shadow puppetry, calligraphy art, and Tang Dynasty music and dance.</p>
        <img src="xian_culture.jpg" alt=" shadow puppetry">
        <h3> shadow puppetry</h3>
        <p>Shadow puppetry is a traditional Chinese folk art that originated in the Western Han Dynasty and flourished in the Tang and Song dynasties, and is very popular for its unique form of performance. Artists manipulate beautifully carved leather puppets and present dramatic stories on a curtain under the projection of light. Shadow figures are made of cow or sheepskin, dyed and carved to make them vividly lifelike. The performance combines music, singing and dialogues, and is based on historical stories, myths and legends. Xi'an, as one of the important birthplaces of shadow theater, still retains a rich shadow culture and has a shadow theater hall where visitors can watch performances and experience production. It is not only a traditional form of entertainment, but also one of the representatives of China's intangible cultural heritage, carrying a deep historical and cultural heritage.</p>
